# PythonCourse

Repo with materials for my own Python Course

## About the course

In this course I will try to cover all of the basics and most important things of Python and teach my group how to learn programing, show that it`s really funny and easy to learn :). I am going to make at least a 2 projects and at the end if my students agree I would like them to write they own projects in pairs with a things that they learn in this course. Moreover if we will have time I would like to show then a good practise of programing and talk more about programing at all. I hope my group will learn the basics really fast and we will chanse to cover more intresting things than raw basics :).

## Course program

## Projects

- I would like to go from the scratch with my students throught 2 projects: Hangman Game and Quiz Game.

## Extra Topics
- As I mentioned before if my group will learn fast the basics and we will end program faster than I expect we can start extra things in Python. For now I predict that extra topics will be more about Functions and Classes.
